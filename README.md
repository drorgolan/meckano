Home Assignment: Customer Relationship
Management
Objective:
Develop a simple web-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) that allows users
to manage customer information. The system should include the ability to add, update,
delete, and view customer details. The users should register and login to the CRM in order
to use it.
Requirements:
1. Backend:
○ Use PHP to handle server-side logic.
○ Implement RESTful APIs to manage customer data.
○ Create basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for contact data.
○ Ensure all API responses return JSON.
○ Validate API inputs as needed.
2. Database:
○ Use MySQL to store customer data.
○ Design a schema for a customers table with fields such as ID, name, email,
address, and phone number.
○ Include SQL scripts for setting up the database.
3. Frontend:
○ Although the focus is on backend, provide a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript
frontend to interact with the API.
○ Use AJAX/Fetch to communicate with the backend services.
4. Code Quality:
○ Organize the code into logical modules.
○ Use object-oriented programming principles.
○ Include comments and documentation where necessary.
5. Security:
○ Implement input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
○ Use secure methods for API authentication (consider JWT or OAuth).
○ Ensure data is sanitized when entering and leaving the system.
6. Scalability and Performance:
○ Write efficient SQL queries to avoid performance bottlenecks.
○ Consider using prepared statements or ORM for database interactions.
7. Tools and Best Practices:
○ Use Composer for dependency management.
○ Use Git for version control and provide a .gitignore file suitable for a PHP
project.
8. Project Planning and Documentation:
○ Provide a README.md file detailing how to set up and run the project,
including environment setup, database configuration, and how to use the APIs.
9. Bonus (Optional):
○ Use a popular Frontend framework like React, Vue, Angular to manage the
UI/UX.
○ Implement unit tests using PHP Unit.
○ Use a modern PHP framework like Laravel or Symfony for the project setup.
○ Add features like pagination, sorting, or filtering in the API.
○ Include a Dockerfile for setting up the development environment easily.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Code Organization: Clarity of architecture and modularity.
● Security Practices: Implementation of security measures against common
vulnerabilities.
● Database Design: Efficiency and structure of database queries.
● Code Quality: Usage of programming best practices and clean, maintainable code.
● Documentation: Completeness and clarity of project documentation.
